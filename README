# Plant Species Classifier

## Overview

The Plant Species Classifier is a machine learning application developed as part of my Computer Science capstone project. The application is designed to classify plant species based on images provided by the user. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can accurately identify a wide range of plant species.

## Features

- Image Classification: Upload an image of a plant, and the application will classify it into one of several species.
- Deep Learning Model: The classifier is powered by a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of plant images.
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive Jupyter Notebook interface allows users to upload images and view classification results easily.

## Usage

The Plant Species Classifier application is divided into two parts: a Jupyter Notebook for training the model, and an interactive Jupyter Notebook designed to run in Google Colab. The model training notebook can either be run locally or in Google Colab.

## Dataset

This application is built around the [Plants Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/plants-classification) dataset from Kaggle. Additional datasets could be used, but could possibly require changes to the model training code depending on the dataset directory structure.
